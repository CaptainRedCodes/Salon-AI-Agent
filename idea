1. AI Agent Setup (First Step) - *** COMPLETED ***
    ● Set up a basic simulated AI agent using LiveKit (you can use their Python SDK or
    another language you prefer).
    ○ Why LiveKit? We are evaluating your ability to research an unfamiliar framework,
    read documentation, and debug in a foreign environment.
    ● Prompt it with basic business information about a fake salon.
    ○ Why LiveKit? We want to evaluate your ability to build good prompts.
    ● The agent doesn't need full conversational handling. You can just use a sample app and
    wrap up this step quickly. You just need to equip your agent with the ability to:
    ○ Receive a call
    ○ Respond if it knows the answer
    ○ Trigger a "request help" event if it doesn't know

2. Human Request Handling
When the AI doesn't know something:
    ● Tell the caller: "Let me check with my supervisor and get back to you."
    ● Create a pending help request.
    ○ You decide how this request is structured in a DB— we will evaluate the
    elegance of your solution. You can use a lightweight DB like DynamoDB/Firebase
    to move fast.

    ● Simulate texting the supervisor:
    ○ E.g., log a console message, or trigger a webhook.

    ○ Content: “Hey, I need help answering [question].”

3. Supervisor Response Handling
    ● Build a simple UI where a human can:
    ○ View pending requests
    ○ Submit answers to pending requests
    ○ See history of resolved/unresolved requests
    ● When the supervisor responds:
    ○ AI should immediately text back the original caller (simulated via webhook or
    console log).
    ○ AI should update its internal knowledge base with the new information.

4. Knowledge Base Updates
    ● Implement a basic system where learned answers are saved.
    ● Include a simple view like a “Learned Answers” section.
